Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    Middleware are functions that can access the request and response object. A middleware function can be used to handle request, modify the response and request or control the application using method like app.use().

What does CRUD stand for? 
  CRUD stands for different operations in an application:
    CREATE - Create new data
    READ - Read data
    UPDATE - Update data
    DELETE - Delete data

You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
    Use process.env global variable, in this case we want our app to access a mongo string variable(I called mine MONGODB_URI).

How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository? Add the .env file to your .gitignore file. I added a .env.local to my .gitignore file.
